We apply a lyrics-to-audio alignment state-of-the-art approach to polyphonic
 pieces from classical Turkish repertoire.
 
\size normal
\color black
A phonetic recognizer is employed, whereby each phoneme is assigned a hidden
 Markov model (HMM).
 Initially trained on speech, the models are adapted on singing voice to
 match the acoustic characteristics of the test dataset.
 Being the first study on lyrics-to-audio alignment applied on Turkish music,
 it could serve as a baseline for singing material with similar musical
 characteristics.
 As part of this work a dataset of
\size default

 recordings from

 the classical music tradition is compiled.
 Experiments, conducted separately for male and female singers, show that
 female singing is aligned more accurately.

 From this perspective, the automatic synchronization between lyrics and

By applying a lyrics-to-audio alignment state-of-the-art approach to classical
 Turkish songs, we aim to outline the research challenges, raised by the
 musical aspects peculiar to this music tradition.
 To this end we compile a dedicated evaluation corpus.
 This work is performed in the context of the CompMusic project

 manner.
 In this respect, the corpus is built as well with the intention to be useful
 for further music retrieval tasks for the Turkish tradition.

 Typical for it is that vocal and accompanying instruments follow the same

 However, the vocal line has usually melodic predominance.

 The Turkish phonology comprises 38 distinctive phonetic sounds, 8 of which

 There are no diphthongs, and when vowels come together, they retain their

In classical Turkish singing an expressive effect occurs frequently: When
 performing vibrato, singers tend to alternate between the original vowel

To date most of the studies of singing voice in general and the automatic

 Since the forced alignment technique was originally developed to carry
 out the alignment between clean speech and text, accompanying instruments
 and non-vocal sections deteriorate the alignment accuracy.
 To address this issue, the authors perform

 is segregated from the polyphonic signal.

Compared to speech, singing voice possesses different acoustic characteristics.
 For example, the pitch of singing voice pertains to the melodic line in
 the song, whereas no such dependence holds for speech prosody.
 as well: the fluctuation of fundamental frequency (F0) and loudness for
 a given singer vary more, compared to when she is speaking.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The idea of adaptation comes from speaker adaptation and aims to transform
 the acoustic space of speaker-independent phoneme models towards the acoustic
 characteristics of a particular speaker.
 This ensures that after adaptation each state of a phoneme model is more
 likely to generate the corresponding phoneme when being sung.

The Maximum a posteriori (MAP) transform - applied as well in this work
 - shifts the mean and variance components of the Gaussians of the speech
 model towards the acoustic characteristics of the singing voice.
 An advantage of the MAP transform compared to other adaptation techniques
 is that it allows the manipulation of each phoneme model independently.

In singing the articulatory characteristics of unvoiced consonants do not
 vary significantly from these in speech.
 This is because unvoiced consonants do not bear any melodic line.
 For this reason we adapted only the vowels and voiced consonants.

 This results ideally in a vocal line, with no audible instruments.
 However, some spectral artifacts from accompanying instruments are inevitable,
 because they follow in parallel the melodic line of the voice.

 To handle these special-case-consonants, they are replaced in the pronunciation

The alignment accuracy for female singing voice is slightly better than
 for male.
 A reason for this is that for female voice the extracted melody line has
 less errors than for male.
 We observed that, when the extracted pitch is wrong (e.g by an octave),
 the vowels are not recognized correctly.

Another problem is that alignment performs poorly towards the end of longer
 sections, which results in outliers of huge magnitude (seen at the distribution
 of the alignment error figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 A glance at the distribution of the alignment error of a lyrics-to-audio
 system for western popular music 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 reveals that the frequency and magnitude of outliers are comparable to
 ours.
 Further, our mean error lies not far from theirs of 1.4 seconds.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work was presented a method for the automatic alignment between
 lyrics and audio recordings of vocal compositions in the classical Turkish
 tradition.
 Performance was evaluated on a dataset, compiled and annotated by us especially
 for this task.
 
\color black
The method showed better results for female singers, which is partly explained
 by the greater amount of erroneously recognized male pitch, which distorts
 the re-synthesized pitch as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect that the generated phrase-to-audio alignment may be a starting
 point for subsequent musicological analysis tasks.

An expected reason for misalignment can be the introduced vocal alternation.
 To show the degree and the frequency of this phenomenon, a parallel experiment
 is conducted: The current sung vowel is visualized in the IPA vowel space,
 using an external tool 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "frostel2011vowel"

\end_inset

.
 Such a visualization will help us identify correlations between alignment
 accuracy and vocal phenomena.

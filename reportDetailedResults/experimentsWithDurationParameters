report: 

TO make sure state sequence covers whole audio
-setting only the initial prob of first state to be diff. than zero assures the optimal path will be at first state.

we backtrack starting at the very last state.


Current state: 
testing only duraations with no ObsProbs. 

Current parameteres:

FIXED:
= Only at middle state - check bookmark in code
=   distribution type: Normal ( allows for 2*maxD(state) (DurationHMM.getWaitLogLik() )
silence has on ly one middle state

-no normalisation of durationPDF
-equalLEngth (no time to test weighted)

ADJUSTABLE: 
	- then play with ALPHA (start at > 0.9)
	- let currMax be 30% on top of note duration (in _calcCurrStatePhi and initPhis)
